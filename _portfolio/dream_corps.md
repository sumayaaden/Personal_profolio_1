I was honored to be a member of the October cohort of Dream Corps Tech x Target 2021. I was able to complete the bootcamp and have a great foundation in the object oriented programming language, Java, with the support of an amazing instructor, mentor, classmates, and overall guidance from the Dream Corps team. Dream Corps provided me with the opportunity to learn more about software engineering while also allowing me to put what I had learned in class into practice. For the first time, I was able to work on constructing programs with my classmates and practice pair programming. Dream Corps is an incredible initiative that I was honored to be a part of, and I hope to help teach more people of color about computer science in the future.</p>
