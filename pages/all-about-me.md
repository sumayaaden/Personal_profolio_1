<!-- My name is Sumaya Aden and I am a recent graduate of Dream Corps Bootcamp. Throughout this bootcamp, I learned about the world of software engineering. I learned about object-oriented programming languages such as Java and used IntelliJ as my IDEA to apply my knowledge. I also learned more about [GitHub](https://github.com/sumayaaden) and created as well as forked repositories. Currently, I am learning more about front-end and back-end development as well as taking a pluralsight courses about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I plan on building my foundation by learning as much as I can about these languages, so it can better prepare me for any new languages/software programs I might need to learn in the future. -->
My name is Sumaya Aden, and I am a recent Dream Corps Bootcamp graduate. I learned about the world of software engineering throughout this bootcamp. I studied object-oriented programming languages like Java and used IntelliJ as my IDEA to put what I learned into practice. I also learned how to use [GitHub](https://github.com/sumayaaden)  and forked and created repositories. I'm now studying more about front-end and back-end development, as well as taking HTML, CSS, and JavaScript classes through Pluralsight. I intend to develop my foundation by studying as much as I can about these languages in order to better prepare myself for any future languages or software packages that I may need to master.

<!-- Aside from constantly learning, in my spare time I like to hang out with my family and friends. Thankfully, our family is huge, so you would rarely find a quiet time in our house. I also love challenging myself to learn new hobbies. I love rollerblading and currently, I'm teaching myself how to skateboard. I have more progress during summer time of course. I love learning random things, so if i'm ever given the opportunity to do such, i will be on it! -->

Aside from constantly learning, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends in my leisure time. Fortunately, because our family is so large, there is rarely a quiet moment in our home. I also enjoy pushing myself to explore different things. I enjoy rollerblading and am currently learning how to skateboard. Of course, I make much better progress over the summer. I enjoy learning new things, so if the opportunity arises, I will take advantage of it!
