<p style="color: #8D5B99" style="font-size:25px"> Hello! <p/>
<br>
My name is Sumaya Aden and I am a recent graduate of Dream Corps Bootcamp. Throughout this bootcamp, I learned about the world of software engineering. I learned about object-oriented programming languages such as Java and used IntelliJ as my IDEA to apply my knowledge. I also learned more about GitHub and created as well as forking repositories. Currently, I am learning more about front-end and back-end development as well as taking a pluralsight course on HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I plan on building my foundation by learning as much as I can about these languages so it can better prepare me for any new languages/software programs I might need to learn in the future. 
 
 
Aside from constantly learning, in my spare time I like to hang out with my family and friends. Thankfully, our family is huge, so you would rarely find a quiet time in our house. I also love challenging myself to learn new hobbies. I love rollerblading and currently, I'm teaching myself how to skateboard. I have more progress during summer time of course. I love learning random things, so if i'm ever given the opportunity to do such, i will be on it!
